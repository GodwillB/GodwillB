My name is Godwill and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:

-   WordPress
- Laravel
- Javascript ES6 
- Node.js
- React
